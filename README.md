# AC_DC-Load
Files for my AC_DC Dynamic Load development project

I will update files as I go through the development.
The files will be development files and not a final version until declared that way.
There will be no version control, what you see is the latest, look at the dates for more information.

Nano-rms-test is the latest functioning prototype for the complete dynamic AC/DC load system, as far as I got. It is very experimental!

Nano-rms-test-V2 is the version that supports the True RMS LTC1966 chip that I now use for the DUT voltage measurements. This is the version that I'm working with now.

Measure_example_rms is a fully functional, interrupt driven rms calculator using the Nano ADC0 input
