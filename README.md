# AC_DC-Load
Files for my AC_DC Dynamic Load development project

I will update files as I go through the development.
The files will be development files and not a final version until declared that way.
There will be no version control, what you see is the latest, look at the dates for more information.

Nano-rms-test is the latest functioning prototype for the complete dynamic AC/DC load system, as far as I got. This will be updated regularly, keep track of the dates for the latest version.

OLED_test2-a is a very(!) experimental and not fully working yet. It's an experiment to use
a rotary encoder to select and set individual digits on an OLED display.

Measure_example_rms is a fully functional, interrupt driven rms calculator using the Nano ADC0 input
