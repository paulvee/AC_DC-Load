# AC_DC-Load
Files for my AC_DC Dynamic Load development project

I will update files as I go through the development.
The files will be development files and not a final version until declared that way.
There will be no version control, what you see is the latest, look at the dates for more information.

OLED is very experimental and not fully working yet.
Measure_example_rms is a fully functional, interrupt driven rms calculator using the Nano ADC0 input
